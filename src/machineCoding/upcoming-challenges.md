# Upcoming Machine Coding Challenges

This document outlines the machine coding challenges we plan to implement in the near future.

## 1. Advanced Todo Application

A feature-rich Todo application with advanced functionality to demonstrate React best practices.

### Key Features
- Task creation, editing, and deletion
- Priority levels and due dates
- Categorization and tagging
- Filtering and sorting options
- Local storage persistence
- Undo/redo functionality

### Technical Requirements
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useReducer, useContext)
- **Code Organization**: Custom hooks for reusable logic
- **Performance**: Optimization techniques for responsive UI
- **Accessibility**: Proper keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes
- **Responsiveness**: Fluid design for all device sizes
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with Jest and React Testing Library

## 2. Future Challenge Ideas

| Challenge | Description | Key Skills |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| ✅ **Tic-Tac-Toe Game** | Implemented with TypeScript, featuring flexible board size (3x3 to 8x8), move history, dark mode support, and accessibility features. Future enhancements: AI opponent, multiplayer support | Game state management, TypeScript, Dynamic Grid Layout, Accessibility |
| ✅ **Tabs Component** | Implemented with full accessibility support, keyboard navigation, dark mode, and Tailwind CSS styling | ARIA roles, Focus management, Content switching, Dark mode theming |
| **Parallel Progress Bars** | Multiple progress bars running simultaneously with configurable speeds and limits | Async state management, requestAnimationFrame, CSS transitions |
| **OTP Input Component** | Multi-field one-time password input with auto-focus and paste support | Controlled inputs, Ref forwarding, Input validation |
| **Ride Sharing Map** | Interactive map with driver/rider locations, routing, and ETA calculations | Map API integration (Google/Mapbox), Geolocation, Route visualization |
| **Nested Checkboxes** | Hierarchical task system with parent-child relationships where parent tasks complete when all children complete | Component composition, State propagation, Tree data structures |
| **Infinite Scrolling with Virtualization** | List component that loads items on demand and only renders visible elements | React-Window/React-Virtualized, Intersection Observer, Performance optimization |
| **Poll Widget** | Interactive voting system with real-time results and data visualization | State management, Chart.js/D3.js, WebSockets for live updates |
| **Video Streaming Component** | Custom video player with adaptive streaming, playback controls, and picture-in-picture | HTML5 Media API, HLS/DASH protocols, MediaSource Extensions |
| **Advanced Dropdown Menu** | Multi-level cascading dropdown with search, grouping, and keyboard navigation | Focus management, Event handling, Portal rendering |
| **Real-time Collaborative Whiteboard** | Multi-user drawing application with real-time updates | WebSockets, Canvas API, React |
| **Kanban Board with Drag-and-Drop** | Task management board with columns and cards | React DnD, Context API, Reducers |
| **Spreadsheet Application** | Excel-like grid with formula calculation | Complex state management, Grid layouts |
| **Calendar Component** | Interactive calendar with event scheduling | Date manipulation, Custom hooks |
| **Multi-step Form** | Complex form with validation and conditional logic | Form state management, Validation |

## 3. Implementation Approach

For each challenge, we will:

1. Define clear requirements and acceptance criteria
2. Create wireframes and component hierarchy
3. Set up the basic structure and data models
4. Implement core functionality with TDD approach
5. Add advanced features and optimizations
6. Document code and usage examples
7. Add comprehensive tests
